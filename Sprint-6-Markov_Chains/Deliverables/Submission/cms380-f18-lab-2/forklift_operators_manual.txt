COURSE AIM
To train suitable personnel in the basic skills and knowledge to enable them to operate Forklift Trucks safely and
efficiently in accordance with the National Load Shifting Guidelines.
This course will enable the operator to achieve a satisfactory standard in regard to:–
• Pre-operation inspection.
• Safety practices and rules.
• Basic information on the Forklift truck such as its design features, centre of gravity, capacity, stability and
limitations.
• Control positions and functions.
• Basic manoeuvres of a Forklift with regard to rear end swing.
• Safe lifting, carrying and lowering of loads of different weights and dimensions and at varying heights.
The Transport Training Centre uses the Standards Association of Australia Guidelines for the operation of
Industrial Trucks. AS2359.2
These Guidelines are based on industry standards and are the minimum under the various Acts and
Regulations.
On successful completion of this course, trainees will be able to operate a Forklift Truck in
accordance with the standards identified in the National Load Shifting Guidelines.
INTRODUCTION
WHAT THIS COURSE IS DESIGNED TO DO.
The Transport Training Centre’s forklift course is carefully designed to give all trainees a better understanding of
the operation of forklift trucks, the problems that may be encountered and, how to minimise the risks to the
operator, other personnel and the PCBU (employer). The practical component will enhance your knowledge and,
give you ideas and information that will assist you to become a better and safer forklift operator.
An advantage will be gained by all trainees by actively participating in class discussions. Operators with previous
experience are encouraged to put forth ideas which may also benefit those trainees who are being exposed to load
shifting equipment for the first time. There are always new things to learn.
IMPORTANCE OF THE COURSE
The objective of this course is to prevent injury and minimise property damage through accidents involving
industrial trucks. Reckless driving, lack of skill and poor operating knowledge can cause and, continues to cause
extensive damage to property, injuries and permanent disabilities and loss of life. Through training we can reduce
the tragedy and personal suffering from accidents, lower costly waste and, improve the efficiency of the workplace.

TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS
SEPARATE PEDESTRIANS AND FORKLIFTS
The best way to reduce the risk of forklift-related injuries is to separate pedestrians and forklifts.
Separating pedestrians and forklifts is the most important aim of your traffic management plan.
A traffic management plan is a set of rules for managing the safest and most efficient movement of traffic in your
workplace. It contains practical, workable controls and covers all vehicles in your workplace, not just forklifts. It
should also be specific to the workplace.
Everyone affected by the plan must understand it and follow it. Don’t wait until an injury or death occurs at your
workplace before separating pedestrians and forklifts.
DEVELOP YOUR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN
PCBUs (employers) and supervisors should develop a traffic management plan by consulting with workers and
others in your workplace, and by using the principles of hazard management:
IDENTIFY THE HAZARD
— associated with the movement of forklifts, other vehicles and pedestrians.
• Study the way forklifts, other vehicles and pedestrians move or need to move around in all areas of your
workplace.
• Identify the places where there is the potential for a collision to occur.
• Consider the physical structure of your workplace. Look at floor surfaces, exits, driveways and
housekeeping standards.
• Ask your workers about any problems they have noticed.
• Review your incident and injury records (including ‘near misses’), as well as manufacturers’ information.
‘Practical issues to consider for your traffic management plan’ can help you decide what needs to be in your traffic
management plan.
ASSESS THE RISK
— caused by these hazards. PCBUs, supervisors and operators should ask these questions:
What is the potential impact of the hazard?
• How severe could an injury be?
• What is the worst possible damage the hazard could cause to someone’s health?
• Would it require simple first aid only? Or could it cause permanent ill health or disability? Or could
it kill? How likely is the hazard to cause someone harm?
• Could it happen at any time or would it be a rare event?
• How frequently are employees exposed to the hazard? You should also consider how many
people are exposed to the hazards
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 11
CONTROL THE RISK
— the most effective way to control risks is to eliminate them in the first place. If it is not practical to
control risks by eliminating them, consider other measures that can minimise them. When considering
potential control measures and deciding which to use, follow the priority order set out in the Hierarchy of
Control:
(1) elimination (most effective control) — e.g. consider options to eliminate the use of forklifts
(2) substitution — e.g. use a safer type of forklift
(3) isolation — e.g. provide an overhead pedestrian walkway
(4) engineering/redesign — e.g. use speed limiting devices on forklifts
(5) administration — e.g. training and/or warning signs
(6) personal protective equipment (least effective control) — e.g. high visibility vests.
Once you have considered potential control measures in the correct order, implement the most effective
controls practical, or a combination of controls. For example, can you eliminate risks by removing forklifts
from your workplace completely? If that is not practical, can you replace them with more people-friendly
load shifting equipment (such as a pallet jack or conveyor system)?
Other control measures might include creating more efficient routes and traffic flows; creating ‘no go’
zones; and using signs and barriers.
REVIEW CONTROL MEASURES
— Review your control measures to ensure they have been implemented and are not creating new
hazards. Repeat the hazard management process at regular intervals and also whenever there is a
change at your workplace or after a near miss or incident.
For more detailed information about the principles of hazard management, call your local
workplace safety authority.
PRACTICAL ISSUES TO CONSIDER FOR YOUR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN
• Designate exclusion zones for pedestrians and forklifts. Use impact barriers to separate pedestrians and
forklifts. Less permanent or less sturdy barriers, such as bollards or expandable fences may be adequate
for temporary demarcation. If less sturdy barriers are used, factor in the likely stopping distances by
considering the weight of the forklift and its expected load and the likely speed of the forklift.
• Audio visual warnings can supplement controls in areas of partial separation. A mix of high volume alarms
and horns coupled with flashing lights best warn pedestrians of approaching forklifts. Flashing lights are
imperative in areas of high levels of ambient workplace noise.
• Consider using proximity devices.
• Safety intersections and blind corners can be managed with devices that ensure pedestrians slow down or
stop, such as swinging or interlocked gates and chicanes. These controls can be enhanced by the addition
of overhead mirrors. Avoid placing bins, racks or storage units that obstruct a forklift operator’s view at
intersections or around corners.
• Use signs, containment fences, boom gates and even overhead walkways. Install signs that indicate who
must give way. Implement and enforce procedures that cover when and how pedestrians and forklifts must
give way to each other.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 12
• Create ‘no go’ zones for forklifts (pedestrian-only areas): e.g. around tearooms, time clocks,
amenities and entrances. Create clearly marked pedestrian crossings.
• Assess traffic destination, flow, volume and priorities (such as rail traffic).
• Consider high-visibility or reflective clothing for pedestrians and workers operating forklifts, and
high-visibility markings for forklifts. However, this is no substitute for physically separating
pedestrians and forklifts. Make sure that any high-visibility clothing does not blend in with other
brightly coloured objects in your workplace.
• Consider speed limits and speed-limiting devices.
• Examine the forklift and its characteristics: movement, stability, attachments, and braking
distances.
• Examine the loads being moved: their height and type.
• Look at security measures.
• Be alert for black spots caused by stationary equipment and vehicles. Black spots must be
controlled.
• Make sure roads are well formed, and clearly marked. Consider making roads two-way
carriageways.
• This list is not exhaustive, and does not replace the principles of hazard management.
RECORD YOU TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN
You should now be able to identify traffic flow, speed limits, parking areas, manoeuvring and loading
areas, ‘no go’ zones, pedestrian crossings, required ‘give ways’, and areas requiring actions in your
workplace.
Detail this information in a site map, and display it in your workplace. Everyone in your workplace,
including contractors and visitors, must know your traffic management plan. Use induction and training
sessions, and post information at workplace entrances and notice boards.
Creating a site map can help you analyse the workplace while developing the traffic management plan.
Once the plan is developed, the finalised site map will help reinforce and communicate the traffic
management plan. Review and monitor the traffic management plan at pre-determined and regular
intervals.

Before commencing a task or as soon as a hazard is identified during an operation the hierarchy of risk control is
used as a logical sequence of steps that should be considered to control hazards in the workplace.
HIERARCHY OF RISK CONTROL TABLE
Until you have a better method of control…
Other hazards within the workplace have specific requirement, for example overhead
powerlines, you must observe the following distances when conducting forklift operations near
uninsulated power lines?
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 16
POLICIES AND SAFE WORK PROCEDURES
Policies and safe work procedures ensure everyone who uses forklifts understands how to do
so safely and correctly.
Policies should cover the hazard management process; selecting a forklift; training and
licences; incident reporting and investigation. Safe work procedures (or operating procedures)
should cover many of the topics discussed in this guide, for example, checking the forklifts and
the workplace, using attachments, operating the forklift, carrying loads, and maintenance. Other
issues you should consider include fatigue, manual handling, refuelling, and battery charging.
As with your traffic management plan, everyone in your workplace, including contractors and
visitors, must know your policies and safe work procedures.
Provide contract staff with the same level of training on traffic management as direct workers.
Manage visitors so there is no possibility of them entering forklift operating areas. If this is not
possible inform them of ‘no-go’ areas or ensure visitors are accompanied by a worker. You
could use induction and training sessions, and post information at workplace entrances and
notice boards.
You should also review these regularly to ensure they remain appropriate and also ensure
people are complying with them.
INCIDENT REPORTING
Develop and implement an incident reporting procedure. Incidents involving forklifts must be
reported immediately to the manager or supervisor.
Reporting incidents allows you to:
• find out what went wrong and why
• improve work practices or the physical environment
• prevent similar incidents happening again. Near misses must also be recorded and
followed up. Reporting near misses can give you the chance of preventing a severe
accident, so treat them seriously. You may use the principles of hazard management in
this process.
It is important that if someone is killed or seriously injured — or could have been killed
or seriously injured at your workplace — Safework SA must be notified.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 17
COMMUNICATION
Involving workers in Health and Safety matters is a legal requirement and makes good business
sense. When management works with workers to achieve shared objectives workers are more
likely to understand decisions and actively support them.

Workers have a good understanding of high-risk activities in their work areas. By setting up a
communication system, where management and employees have a genuine opportunity to
exchange views, informed decisions can be made based on shared information. Effective
worker involvement and cooperation assists in preventing incidents, injuries and ill health. For
example communication could be used to alert workers of:
• Emergency situation
• The nature of the emergency
• Unsafe work areas or zones
• Information to emergency services i.e. ambulance, police or fire services personnel
The PCBU (person conducting a business or undertaking) should actively consider
arrangements for establishing formal consultative methods. For example, in larger organisations
consider health and safety representatives and safety committees. These arrangements should
be developed in consultation with workers, documented and communicated to everybody. For
smaller organisations, less formal systems such as regular 'toolbox' or safety communications
meetings can be considered. Some organisations combine formal and informal communication
methods very effectively. Communication methods could be:
• Visual Communication – WHS specially designed signs, electronic communication,
documents, and even presentation
• Written Communication – KPI reports, evaluations, emails, instant messages, physical
and electronic memos, training materials, and other types of documents i.e. Safety Data
Sheets
• Verbal Communication – Toolbox meetings, instructions and public address messages
(i.e. fire drills). Verbal communication would also involve active listening by workers
and supervisors to ensure the message is clear and understood
• Feedback Communication – Questioning to confirm understanding of workplace
communication and/or safe procedures
Any proposed changes to the work environment, work processes or the WHS management
system must be discussed with workers. PCBUs (Employers) must involve workers, so that
potential health and safety issues can be identified and resolved. Workers have the practical
experience that is valuable in ensuring that workplace changes are implemented effectively and
do not create further risks.
Training must be provided to all staff to ensure the communication you have established is
effective.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 18
OVERHEAD POWERLINES
The following distances MUST be observed when performing any work under or near to
overhead power lines.
• Low Voltage with a spotter: 3 m
• Low Voltage without a spotter: 6.4 m
• High Voltage with a spotter: 8 m
• High Voltage without a spotter: 10 m
If you are required to work closer than these minimum distances, the following controls could be
used to do this safely?
Controls include, but not limited to:
• Must seek an exemption from the relevant authority.
• Where possible have the electricity power shut off.
• If this is not possible, the power lines must be insulated.
• Depending on legislation of the state/territory, the use of a spotter within the exclusion
zone may be appropriate.
What is the best method to determine the voltage of over head power lines?
• Refer to the local power authority for advice
What should you do if the forklift truck you are operating comes into contact with power lines?
• If possible & without danger to self:
o Attempt to break the forklift’s contact with the power line by moving the forklift or

FORKS
TYPES OF FORKS
The Pallet is the most common type of fork is use. It is designed to handle pallets or skids.
These forks are sometimes tapered on the bottom face so they can be used to chisel under
certain types of loads.
The Polished and Tapered fork is primarily used for chiselling operations. It is a thin fork that
has a very smooth finish. These forks can be tapered either top or bottom depending on the
intended chiselling operation. This fork can also be used for handling pallets or skids.
The Plywood fork is primarily used in the timber business. It is wider and thinner than a
regular fork and enables the operator to “chisel” between laminated timber sheets.
LENGTHS OF FORKS
The forks that are used should always be shorter than the load being handled. For example, a
standard pallet is 1200mm in length, therefore, the forks to be used should be approximately
1000mm in length. Fork length should always be shorter than the load length. Forks which
protrude beyond the load may cause damage; however, if the forks are too short then load
stability will be at risk. If ever faced with the situation where the forks are longer than the load,
the operator should endeavour to travel in reverse with the forks trailing.
As a general rule forks should always extend at least 75% of the distance under the load.
FORK EXTENSIONS (SLIPPERS)
Fork extensions are generally used to handle long loads. The slide over the regular forks and
give added length.
Fork extensions are an attachment and their weight should be taken into account as part of the
load being carried by the forklift. Using fork extensions eliminates the necessity to have more
than one pair of forks.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 23
LOAD LENGTH, FORK LENGTH & SPACING
SPACING
When picking up a wide load, the forks should be evenly spread out toward the sides of the
load.
The key points are to use the proper length of forks spaced correctly for the load. In most
cases load handling is performed with pallets.
 (1200mm x 1200mm for a standard Chep or Loscam Pallet).
The distance between the forks should be adjusted to be approximately between two thirds or
three quarters of the overall width of the pallet to give the strongest support and to enable
greater ease of manoeuvrability especially when stacking or de-stacking in confined areas.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 24
FORK HEIGHT TERMINOLOGY
A. The Collapsed Height is the
distance from the floor to the top
of the mast when the forks are in
their lowest position.
B. Free Lift is the distance the
forks may be raised before the
Collapsed Height is increased.
C. The Maximum Fork Height is
the distance from the floor to the
top of the forks when the mast is
fully raised.
D. Overall Extended Height
is the distance from the floor to
the top of the load back rest
extension when the mast is
fully raised.

LIFT TRUCK STEERING FEATURES
REAR END STEERING
A. This allows the Truck to turn much sharper than those steered by the front wheels.
B. Tail swing is a characteristic of Forklift Trucks. This is the direct result of being steered
by the rear wheels. Operators need to become accustomed to this peculiarity in order to
avoid accidents.
WILL NOT SELF CENTRE
A. Before boarding the machine check the position of the rear wheels.
B. One hand must be on the steering wheel at all times during operation.
C. Travel at a safe speed to enable manoeuvres to be carried out safely.
POWER STEERING
A. Turn steering only when the forklift is moving.
B. If the forklift is fitted with pneumatic tyres ensure that they are inflated to
recommended pressures.
Never switch the engine off whilst the vehicle is in motion. Loss of engine power will result in
loss of power steering function.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 26
REAR WHEEL STEERING
The ability to drive an ordinary motor vehicle does not necessarily mean that a person is
capable of handling a forklift truck. The effect of rear wheel steering is similar to driving an
ordinary vehicle in reverse.
SPECIAL STEERING CHARACTERISTICS
Rear wheel steering also imposes different steering characteristics. When an ordinary vehicle is
turning, the rear wheels will “track” inside the turning arc of the front wheels. With rear wheel
steering, the rear wheels will “track” outside the front wheel arc. This action induces the
characteristic of rear end swing.
REAR END SWING
The tendency for the rear end to swing outside the arc of forward movement will become
apparent when observing the progress of the front of the vehicle. Rear end swing is a major
contributor to a considerable number of accidents involving forklift trucks. Novice drivers need
to be particularly careful of this feature.
Additionally, rear wheel steered vehicles will not revert
from a turning arc to a straight course if the steering
wheel is released. The tendency is for the turn to be
continued in a decreasing circular movement until
maximum lock is reached.
THE SPEED OF REAR END SWING WILL BE APPROXIMATELY
3 TIMES THE FORWARD SPEED OF THE FORKLIFT

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 27
TYPES OF PROPULSION
There are two distinct types of propulsion for forklifts: Internal Combustion Engines and Battery
Electric.
INTERNAL COMBUSTION
The internal combustion engine in a forklift works on the very same principles as those in a
normal motor vehicle. The variety of fuel sources are also similar to those of a normal motor
car and include petrol, diesel, LPG and CNG (compressed natural gas).
Gas powered vehicles are more often used indoors whereas those powered by petrol or diesel
are often larger and are used in outdoor environments. Petrol emits more toxic fumes (carbon
monoxide) than those using either LPG, CNG or diesel. Even with the advent of catalytic
mufflers these engines should not be idled unnecessarily in confined spaces.
More forklifts use the internal combustion engine rather than
battery power because of its greater versatility as a power
source. Considering that an internal combustion engine develops
more torque than a battery powered vehicle, it yields more
power. As a consequence, internal combustion engine forklifts
will have a higher grade climbing ability than a comparable
battery powered machine. Large outdoor forklifts always use
internal combustion engine due to their power requirements.
BATTERY
The major differences apparent in battery operated forklifts is that they are fume free, quiet
and, can be built to a smaller scale and should be maintained as to manufacturer’s
specifications.
Being fume free means they are ideally suited for use in
operations such as food processing or, manufacturing plants
where people are working in confined or poorly ventilated
areas. Their quietness is beneficial when used in an area
where noise would create a disturbance to workers. In contrast
to the internal combustion engine, the battery operated forklift
has fewer parts and can be built more compactly.
Lead acid batteries should be stored in a cool well ventilated area away from ignition sources
(eg welding, smoking etc.). A spill tray should be installed under the battery to contain any
spill. If installed batteries are at risk of metal tools or other conductive materials touching
terminals, then the terminals should be insulated.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 28
TYRES
There are four basic types of tyres used on forklifts.
• Pneumatic Tyres: Similar to those used on motor vehicles which are inflated with air.
• Semi-Pneumatic Tyres: Hollow centred tyres that operate at atmospheric pressure.
• Solid Tyres: A ring of solid rubber, neoprene or other rubber like material around the
wheel rim.
• Cushion Tyres: A solid tyre, but with a different tread and profile configuration to give it
some of the shock absorbing qualities not found in a solid tyre.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 29
CONTROLS AND INSTRUMENTS
HOUR METER
A most important instrument for which there are two reasons:-
1. Service intervals can be determined by worked hours on the machine. Similar to using
odometer readings for the servicing of motor vehicles.
2. Refuelling and even records of operating costs can be determined through hours worked.
CONTROLS
Some forklift truck controls are similar to, and operate in the same way as those found in a car:-
accelerator, brake, hand brake for parking.
Forklifts fitted with gear boxes giving a range of forward and reverse gears should always begin
travelling in the lowest gear possible. Low gear should also be used on ramps and when load
positioning.
INCHING
The majority of forklift trucks are equipped with power shift transmissions. In this case a clutch is
not required to change gear. The third pedal provided on some forklifts, mounted in the normal
position for a clutch, is an “inching pedal” (“clutch brake”). Use of this pedal by the operator
enables the truck to “inch” or move very slowly when operating in confined spaces or when fine
manoeuvring is required. The pedal is pressed part way in to “inch”. Depressing the pedal past
the inching position will apply the brake.
By using the inching pedal the operator is able to control the speed of the machine as well as
being able to neutralise the transmission and stop the machine. Once fully depressed, the
inching pedal will hold the machine (maximum braking), and neutralise the transmission without
having to move the gear selector. The accelerator can then be used for better hydraulic
response when initiating stacking, de-stacking and other static load shifting operations.
VERSATILITY
Forklift trucks can be made extremely versatile by adding to or replacing the forks with
attachments. Clamps, revolving carriages, booms, jibs and even shovels form just a few of the
attachments available. The most common attachment is the “side shift” which allows movement
of the forks up to 100mm (4 inches) left or right of centre of the mast.

PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the following section is to explain the PRINCIPLES which govern the operation
of forklift trucks.
In particular we shall be considering the concepts of:
• PIVOT POINT
• LOAD RATING
• LONGITUDINAL STABILITY
• LATERAL STABILITY
• CENTRE OF GRAVITY
• STABILITY TRIANGLE
An understanding of these principles is essential to gain an appreciation of the capabilities and
limitations of the forklift.
Most importantly, knowing these principles, will allow the operator to anticipate dangerous
situations and thus maintain a safer operation.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 31
PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION
FULCRUM OF BALANCE
The same principles that apply to a see-saw apply to a forklift. In diagrams A & B, equal weights
are placed an equal distance apart from the pivot point, the result is that they remain balanced.
This is SAFE. Note:- the pivot point of the forklift is at the front wheels.
The counterweight of the forklift must always be greater than the load. In the following
diagrams, counterweight C is greater than load D. This is SAFE.
In diagrams E & F a heavier load has been placed at one end. As a consequence a loss of
balance will occur. This is UNSAFE.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 32
UNDERCUTTING THE LOAD
In the diagrams below, equal weights have been placed each side of the pivot point, however
one of the weights has been placed further away from the pivot point than the other. When
operating a forklift this is called undercutting the load. This is UNSAFE.
Even if the weight of the load is less than the counterweight, by moving the load further away
from the pivot point, we can cause the forklift to tip forward. This is UNSAFE.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 33
LONGITUDINAL (FORWARD) STABILITY
There are several causes of forward instability. Overloading the forklift should never occur. This
is a highly dangerous practice and will invariably cause the forklift to tip forward. Other causes
of forward loss of balance can be cited as:
• Tilting the mast forward with the load raised high (diagram A). Undercutting the load
(diagram B)
• Travelling downhill or down a ramp with the load leading (diagram C)
Violent braking is another cause of forward instability and should be avoided at all costs
LATERAL (SIDEWAYS) STABILITY
Causes of sideways instability are:
• Travelling over uneven ground, pot holes etc., (diagram 1).
• Having the load unevenly balanced (diagram 2).
• Turning too fast (diagram 3)*.
* The most potential for disaster is turning too quickly. With rear end steering and moving at an
approximate speed of 10kph, turning the steering will cause the rear to accelerate to 3 times the
forward speed of the machine ie. 30kph. This can easily cause the forklift to tip sideways.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 34
STABILITY - SUMMARY
FORWARD STABILITY
Is affected by: 1. Overloading
2. Sudden stops
3. Rough operation of controls
4. Exceeding load centre
5. Negotiating inclines
6. Collision with overhead obstructions
SIDE STABILITY
Is affected by: 1. Turning too fast
2. Turning on an incline
3. Incorrect tyre pressure
4. Ground obstructions
5. Unbalanced loads
Loads carried high with too much tilt and side-shift
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 35
STABILITY TRIANGLE
One of the most important concepts to understand about forklifts is that even though they have
4 wheels, they are only suspended at 3 points. The rear steering axle is mounted to the truck by
means of a pivot pin in the centre of the axle. This method of suspension allows for some
flexibility when travelling over rough ground.
Diagram A shows an imaginary triangle drawn between the two front wheels and the pivot pin in
the rear axle. The area within the lines is referred to as the Stability Triangle/Pyramid.
The centre of gravity of an object is the point within that object from which it could be
suspended in mid-air perfectly balanced. Whenever operating a forklift, the centre of gravity
must remain within the boundaries of the stability triangle, if not, the forklift will tip over.
Diagrams 1 to 6 describe what happens to the centre of gravity during normal operation. Some
forklifts have more degree of tilt than others and it should be noted that full backward or forward
tilt should only be used under prescribed circumstances.

LOAD CENTRE DEFINITION
Load Centre: The distance measured from the vertical face of the forks to the centre of gravity
of the load. Providing that the weight of the load is evenly distributed and the load is
against the backrest a more simple definition of load centre is Half the Length of the
Load.
In Diagram A the load length measures 1200mm (standard pallet) so the load centre is 600mm.
In Diagram B the load measures 1400mm, therefore, the load centre is 700mm.

MANUFACTURER’S DATA PLATES
DATA PLATES
The data plate attached to the forklift is an integral part of the safe operation of the forklift. After
studying the information you are made aware of the forklift’s maximum lifting capacity, load
centre and, maximum stacking height.
The data plate above describes that the machine can lift a maximum of 2150kg to a maximum
height of 3700mm providing the load centre does not exceed 600mm. When an attachment has
been added the data plate will show a reduced lifting capacity. The attachment (in this case a
“sideshift”) which has been added weighs 325kg. In consideration that this weight has been
added forward of the pivot point (the front wheels) the capacity of the forklift is reduced by the
weight of the attachment. The revised lifting capacity is calculated in the following manner:
Rated capacity 2150kg
Less - weight of attachment - 325kg
Reduced capacity = 1825kg
If a data plate is missing or unreadable, tag and report. Do not use.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 38
LOAD CENTRE AND LIFTING CAPACITY
 1. 2. 3.
LIFT CAPACITY DECREASES AS THE LOAD CENTRE INCREASES
In Diagram 1 a forklift rated for lifting 2000kg with a 600mm load centre can safely lift the load,
providing the load is evenly distributed. In Diagram 2 the load centre has increased to 750mm
so the lifting capacity is reduced to 1700kg. In Diagram 3 the load centre has been increased
even further to 900mm so the lifting capacity is further reduced to 1400kg.
LOAD RATING GRAPH
The graph shows how the load capacity decreases as the load centre increases. The forklift
described on the graph can lift 3000kg as long as the load centre is 600mm or less. As the load
centre increases beyond 600mm, the lifting capacity is reduced, e.g. for a 750mm load centre
the lifting capacity is reduced to 2250kg. For a 900mm load centre the lifting capacity is further
reduced to 1750kg.
Under no circumstances can a forklift lift a greater load than the
stated maximum
- even if the load centre is less than that stated!

JIB ATTACHMENTS - USING THE FORKLIFT AS A CRANE
To further increase the versatility of a forklift truck, the use of a Jib attachment enables the
forklift to be used as a crane.
Before attempting to operate the forklift in this fashion it is important that the operator observe
certain safe practices and be aware of the operating requirements associated with any
equipment used in conjunction with the crane function.
1. Before attempting to lift a load using a jib attachment, the operator must ensure that the
attachment is:–
• in good order and condition;
• is correctly secured to the forklift;
• is fitted with a swivel hook (not a fixed hook); and
• is of suitable capacity for the lifting operation to be performed (the Safe Working Load
must be marked clearly at each hook position on the attachment).
2. When travelling with a load on the jib (hung load) the operator must ensure that
• the mast of the forklift is kept vertical or on back tilt at all times;
• the load is kept as low to the ground as possible;
• the jib attachment is kept as low to the ground as possible by using slings which are as
short as practicable to allow the task to be carried out safely; and
• when travelling and changing direction, forklift speed must be slow.
3. Only equipment which is specifically designed for the purpose should be used with a jib
attachment. NEVER hook or wrap slings around the tines of a forklift.
4. The operator must ensure that any slings or other fittings which are to be used are of a
capacity suitable for the task. The capacity of synthetic webbing slings is easily determined
by a colour coding method, as well as by the information tag attached to the sling by the
manufacturer. The capacity of flexible steel wire ropes and chains appears on the tag affixed
to the sling or is stamped on the ferrule.
5. The operator must ensure that all lifting gear is in good condition. All fittings must be
inspected for wear and damage. The maximum amount of wear permissible in a shackle is
10%. The shackle must be discarded at that point.
6. Loads must be correctly slung and must be secure before lifting.
7. The forklift must be on solid level terrain before lifting.
8. The operator must lift the load slowly and smoothly avoiding rough operation of controls
which could destabilise the forklift.
9. Ensure that the fork is centred directly over the load to minimise the possibility of the load
swinging. Once the load begins to swing the stability of the forklift is adversely affected.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 44
10. Where the load needs to be guided, tag lines made of dry, natural fibre rope of a minimum
diameter of 16mm should be used.
11. If at any stage the operator detects that the load has become unstable, the load should be
lowered immediately.
12. Loads should NEVER be raised over or near other people.
13. The pin of a shackle should always be “moused” (secured or tied in or secured to prevent it
from unscrewing during use).
LOAD FACTORS
The WLL of a sling is the maximum weight which can be lifted when the sling is vertical (a
straight lift). The load factor of a straight lift is 1. By altering the method of slinging, or, by
adjusting the angle between the legs of slings will affect the lifting capacity of the sling.
SLINGS
CARE OF SLINGS
1. When not in use, slings should never be allowed to remain on the ground, on wet and damp
surfaces, near substances which could cause corrosion or wear that may absorb rust, other
oxidants, or ashes.
2. Slings should not be dragged from beneath loads.
3. If slings will be contacting sharp edges etc., adequate packing should be used to prevent
damage.
4. Slings should never be overloaded or shock loaded.
5. Slings should never be exposed to excessive heat.
6. Slings should never be left exposed to the weather and must be kept away from salt water.
7. Operators should take care to prevent twists from developing, and should never knot or
cross twist kink any sling.
8. Slings should be inspected EVERY time before use and operators should inspect for:
• Broken wires or fibres
• Kinks
• High stranding
• Core slippage
• Excessive wear and corrosion
• Crushed or jammed strands
• Signs of stretching
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 45
INSPECTION OF SLINGS
CHAINS:
• Stretched, gouged, pitted or cut links
• Links locked or do not move freely
• Knots, twists and kinks
• Links crushed or worn more than 10% of their original diameter
• Cracked links
Most wear is likely to appear at the ends of each link or on the outer side of each link from being
dragged.
SYNTHETIC SLINGS:
• Damage to stitching, sleeve or protective coating
• Damage to eyes or to end fittings
• Abrasions, cuts and tears
• Variation in sling thickness
• Ensure labels are present
FIBRE ROPES:
• Knots, cuts or an excessive amount of broken fibres
• Rot due to moisture or sun baking
• Disintegration due to contact with corrosive chemicals
• High stranding
Should any of the above be found in the condition of the sling, then the sling should be taken
out of service immediately and either be repaired (where possible), or dis-carded from use. To
ensure that faulty equipment is not used by unsuspecting par-ties, all equipment withdrawn
from service should be clearly marked.

BASIC DE-STACKING RULES
1. Approach the stack slowly, square and centre and
stop half to 1 metre from the stack. At this point bring
the mast to the vertical.
2. Left foot on inching brake (if equipped) - right foot
covering the accelerator (RPM may be required for
better hydraulic response). Raise forks to a position
permitting clear entry into the pallet or dunage.
3. Fully engage the forks by moving forward into the
pallet until the front face of the forks “kiss” the deck
board. (Slight forward tilt may assist).
4. Lift the load until clear of the stack (approx 100mm)
and apply just enough back tilt to stabilise the load. Do
not apply backward tilt before lifting.
5. When the load is clear of the stack or rack look behind
to make sure the way is clear before reversing. Move
slowly backwards only as far as is necessary to clear
the face of the stack. (Approx half to 1 metre).
6. Lower the load gently to the correct travelling height,
approx. 100-150mm before applying further back tilt to
cradle the load before moving off.
7. Extreme care must be taken to avoid jerking the
controls when tilting a load backward or forward -
especially when the load is at height.

BASIC STACKING RULES
1. Approach stack slowly, square and centre with load low,
approx. 100-150mm high and tilted back to cradle the load
against the backrest.
2. Stop approximately half to 1 metre from the stack and
reduce the excessive back tilt.
3. Left foot on inching brake right foot covering the accelerator
(RPM may be required for better hydraulic response). Raise
the load to just above the required stacking height.
4. When the load is clear of the top, move forward into or over
the stack and stop approximately 200mm from the bottom
of the stack or rack.
5. Bring the mast to the vertical (the mast will then be close to
the stack and the forks should be in the horizontal position)
then gently lower the load onto the stack or rack.
6. When the load is securely stacked, lower the forks until
clear of the pallet. Look behind before reversing.
7. When clear of the rack (half to 1 metre) lower the forks to
the correct travelling height, approx 100-150mm before
moving off.

REACH TRUCK INTRODUCTION
A reach truck is a forklift with a load carriage which moves longitudinally relative to the truck,
away from the truck to pick up or deposit a load and toward the truck to enable the centre of
gravity of the load to be within the wheelbase of the truck whilst travelling.
Reach trucks are designed for narrow aisle work where manoeuvring space is generally more
restricted. Therefore, even greater care needs to be taken to avoid damaging racks, loads and,
the truck itself.
The data plate or rating plate on these trucks shows the maximum load that can be safely lifted
by the forklift when the mast or fork carriage is fully extended forward.
Loads in excess of this rating will cause the rear wheels to lift off the ground which in turn will
affect steering, braking and traction. This will endanger the operator and other persons in the
vicinity.
Reach trucks are designed to operate on clean, smooth and level floors. They have no
suspension, nor do they have the shock absorbing qualities of pneumatic tyres. They must not
be driven over floor hazards, broken pallets and other obstructions on floors.
All rules of operating counterbalanced trucks apply equally to non-counterbalanced trucks,
especially those rules which apply to loads when the forks are “reached” forward of the
stabilising wheels. There are additional special rules which must be observed when using reach
trucks.
It is important to remember that a forklift can lift its recommended maximum load only if the
centre of gravity of the load does not extend beyond its rated load centre and is not lifted to a
height greater than that shown on the data plate.
Note: The data plate for a reach truck refers to the capacity of the unit with the forks
REACHED FORWARD.
REACH TRUCK LOAD TABLE AND LOAD CENTRE
The table below shows a reach truck with a rated capacity of 1800kg with a load centre of
600mm. As can be seen by the load table, if the load centre extends beyond the 600mm rating,
the safe working load is reduced.

REACH TRUCK DE-STACKING
1. Stop at the face of the stack and bring the mast to the
vertical position. If necessary, adjust the fork spread to suit
the width of the load and ensure that the weight of the load
is within the rated capacity of the machine.
2. Raise the forks to a position allowing clear entry into the
pallet or dunage strips.
3. Drive forward to bring the truck closer to the stack. Fully
insert the fork arms by reaching forward.
4. Lift the load until it is clear of the stack and carefully apply
enough backward tilt to stabilise the load.
5. When the load is clear of the top of the stack, reach back. If
necessary move the truck back sufficiently to clear the face
of the stack.
Ensure the way is clear before moving off and, take care
not to dislodge loads in adjacent stacks.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 50
REACH TRUCK STACKING
Reach trucks should never be driven, whether loaded or not, with
the reach mechanism extended. The brake should be applied
before operating the reach mechanism. No one should ever step
over the reach legs or put any part of the body between the mast
and power unit if the truck is capable of being operated. The
reach mechanism should not be used for pushing or dragging
loads and, the load should be carried on the forks and not resting
on the reach legs unless the truck is specifically designed for this
purpose.
LOADING AND STACKING WITH REACH TRUCKS
1. Approach the stack with the load low, reached back
and tilted backwards to cradle the load.
2. Stop at the face of the stack, apply the brakes and
reduce the excessive backtilt.
3. Raise the load to the required stacking height.
4. When the load is clear of the top of the stack, drive
forward if necessary, re-apply the brakes then reach
forward taking care not to disturb other loads in
adjacent stacks.
5. When the load is over the stack, bring the mast to the
vertical position and lower the load onto the stack.
6. When the load is securely stacked, lower the arms
until free of the pallet and reach back. At this position,
slight forward tilt might be of assistance, otherwise it
should seldom be necessary to use forward tilt. If the
fork arms are not fully clear of the stack, the truck
should be moved back a short distance, after ensuring
the way is clear.
7. When the fork arms are clear of the stack, re-apply the
brakes if the truck has been moved. Tilt the fork arms
backwards and lower them to just above ground level
before moving off.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 54
RULES FOR SAFE OPERATION OF FORKLIFTS
Only properly trained and authorized drivers should operate forklift trucks.
Are you qualified to be a forklift truck operator?
Are you familiar with the forklift truck you operate?
DON’T OVERLOAD
Check load weights and handle only within the rated capacity of
your forklift truck
Before picking up a load, be sure of where the load centre is
located
Safe operation requires understanding and observing the fork-lift
trucks rated load capacity
GO SLOW AND SOUND HORN AT CORNERS
Go slow whenever vision is limited or obstructed.
If your plant has traffic mirrors, use them.
Observe stop signs, stop your forklift truck completely,
sound the horn if necessary and then proceed with
extreme caution.
ALWAYS USE LOAD BACKREST EXTENSION and OVER-HEAD GUARD FOR HIGH
STACKING
Be especially alert for falling objects when high stacking.
Make sure no loose articles are lying on top of the load
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 55
RULES FOR SAFE OPERATION OF FORKLIFTS
SLOW DOWN FOR SLIPPERY AREAS
It is very easy to lose control in slippery conditions.
Driving a forklift truck is not trying to win a
Safari Rally, although the conditions may
sometimes be rather similar!
WATCH SIDE CLEARANCE
Watch your side clearance, especially with wide loads.
Where possible, drive in the centre of the aisle to avoid
endangering personnel and equipment.
WATCH REAR END SWING
Because the rear wheels steer your truck, the rear end
swings wide when you turn.
Use care in aisles and other tight places.
DON’T CARRY PASSENGERS
Don’t use your forklift truck for moving loads for
which it was not designed.
There is NO safe place on a forklift truck for a
passenger to ride, and they could fall off
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 56
RULES FOR SAFE OPERATION OF FORKLIFTS
AVOID RUNNING OVER LOOSE OBJECTS
Remove hazardous, loose objects rather than driving over
or around them.
Avoid holes and bumps that might disturb your load.
DO NOT PERMIT ANYONE TO STAND UNDER ELEVATED FORKS
Never stand or pass, or permit anyone else to stand or
pass under the elevated forks whether empty or
loaded.
Load could fall, hydraulic or mechanical failure or
operator error
SEAT BELTS
Ensure seatbelts are correctly fitted and worn (for example, by installing intelligent systems, the
forklift can only be started if the seatbelt is fastened).
Monitoring/supervision of these intelligent systems should be such that they cannot be easily
defeated. Seatbelts may be retro-fitted, but only in accordance with the manufacturer’s
specifications.
Tipping over is the biggest danger for a worker using a forklift! If a worker jumps from a tipping
forklift, the chances of serious injury are high. Seatbelts save lives and must be worn.
A forklift can tip over by rolling or overturning sideways; or by pitching forward when the back
wheels lift off the ground.
Forklifts can tip over if you:
• accelerate quickly in reverse;
• brake too quickly, especially on a loaded forklift;
• brake or accelerate while cornering;
• brake or accelerate down a slope;
• carry a load facing down a slope;
• carry an unevenly balanced load;
• collide with another vehicle;
• drive across inclines or uneven ground, such as potholes (particularly with a height
difference greater than 20mm across the front wheels);
• drive with the fork arms raised too high (loaded or unloaded);
• strike low doors or overhead structures;
• turn too fast; or
• use a forklift that is not designed to tow (pushing or pulling)

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 57
CALCULATION
LENGTH
You can measure how long things are, or how tall, or how far apart they are. Those are all
examples of length measurements.
Example: This fork is 20 centimeters long. These are the most common measurements:
• Millimeters
• Centimeters
• Meters
• Kilometers
AREA
The formula is:
Area = w × h
w = width
h = height
Example: What is the area of this rectangle?
We know w = 5 and h = 3, so:
Area = 5 × 3 = 15
Mass (Weight)
Mass: how much matter is in an object.
We measure mass by weighing, but Weight and Mass are not really the same thing.
These are the most common measurements:
• Grams
• Kilograms
• Tonnes
Grams are the smallest, Tonnes are the biggest.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 58
Grams
A paperclip weighs about 1 gram.
Grams are often written as g (for short), so "300 g" means "300 grams".
A loaf of bread weighs about 700 g (for a nice sized loaf)
Kilograms
Once you have 1,000 grams, you have 1 kilogram.
1 kilogram = 1,000 grams
A dictionary has a mass of about one kilogram.
Kilograms are great for measuring things that can be lifted by people (sometimes very strong
people are needed of course!).
Kilograms are often written as kg (that is a "k" for "kilo" and a "g" for "gram), so
"10 kg" means "10 kilograms".
When you weigh yourself on a scale, you would use kilograms. An adult weighs
about 70 kg.
But when it comes to things that are very heavy, we need to use the tonne.
Tonne
Once you have 1,000 kilograms, you will have 1 tonne.
1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms
Tonnes (also called Metric Tons) are used to measure things that are
very heavy.
Things like cars, trucks and large cargo boxes are weighed using the
tonne.
This forklift weighs about 2.5 tonnes.
Tonnes are often written as t (for short), so "2.5 t" means "2.5 tonnes".
Final thoughts about measuring weight:
1 kilogram = 1,000 grams
1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms
Weight or Mass?
We have used the word "weight" only because that is what people commonly say.
But we really should use is "Mass".

EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ASSESSMENTS - 1
The load to be moved is cartons that are stacked on a pallet:
• Four to a layer
• Five layers on the pallet
• The pallet is standard size and weighs 30 kg
• Each carton is 25 kg

What is the combined weight of the cartons and pallet?
 Show all calculations.
EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ASSESSMENTS - 2
The load to be moved is a rectangular block of concrete. The dimensions of the
load are:
• Height 1 meters
• Width 1 metres
• Length 1 metres
Solid concrete has a mass of 2,400 kg per cubic metre
Calculate the approximate weight (mass) of the load in tonnes.
 Show all calculations.

COURSE AIM
To train suitable personnel in the basic skills and knowledge to enable them to operate Forklift Trucks safely and
efficiently in accordance with the National Load Shifting Guidelines.
This course will enable the operator to achieve a satisfactory standard in regard to:–
• Pre-operation inspection.
• Safety practices and rules.
• Basic information on the Forklift truck such as its design features, centre of gravity, capacity, stability and
limitations.
• Control positions and functions.
• Basic manoeuvres of a Forklift with regard to rear end swing.
• Safe lifting, carrying and lowering of loads of different weights and dimensions and at varying heights.
The Transport Training Centre uses the Standards Association of Australia Guidelines for the operation of
Industrial Trucks. AS2359.2
These Guidelines are based on industry standards and are the minimum under the various Acts and
Regulations.
On successful completion of this course, trainees will be able to operate a Forklift Truck in
accordance with the standards identified in the National Load Shifting Guidelines.
INTRODUCTION
WHAT THIS COURSE IS DESIGNED TO DO.
The Transport Training Centre’s forklift course is carefully designed to give all trainees a better understanding of
the operation of forklift trucks, the problems that may be encountered and, how to minimise the risks to the
operator, other personnel and the PCBU (employer). The practical component will enhance your knowledge and,
give you ideas and information that will assist you to become a better and safer forklift operator.
An advantage will be gained by all trainees by actively participating in class discussions. Operators with previous
experience are encouraged to put forth ideas which may also benefit those trainees who are being exposed to load
shifting equipment for the first time. There are always new things to learn.
IMPORTANCE OF THE COURSE
The objective of this course is to prevent injury and minimise property damage through accidents involving
industrial trucks. Reckless driving, lack of skill and poor operating knowledge can cause and, continues to cause
extensive damage to property, injuries and permanent disabilities and loss of life. Through training we can reduce
the tragedy and personal suffering from accidents, lower costly waste and, improve the efficiency of the workplace.

TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS
SEPARATE PEDESTRIANS AND FORKLIFTS
The best way to reduce the risk of forklift-related injuries is to separate pedestrians and forklifts.
Separating pedestrians and forklifts is the most important aim of your traffic management plan.
A traffic management plan is a set of rules for managing the safest and most efficient movement of traffic in your
workplace. It contains practical, workable controls and covers all vehicles in your workplace, not just forklifts. It
should also be specific to the workplace.
Everyone affected by the plan must understand it and follow it. Don’t wait until an injury or death occurs at your
workplace before separating pedestrians and forklifts.
DEVELOP YOUR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN
PCBUs (employers) and supervisors should develop a traffic management plan by consulting with workers and
others in your workplace, and by using the principles of hazard management:
IDENTIFY THE HAZARD
— associated with the movement of forklifts, other vehicles and pedestrians.
• Study the way forklifts, other vehicles and pedestrians move or need to move around in all areas of your
workplace.
• Identify the places where there is the potential for a collision to occur.
• Consider the physical structure of your workplace. Look at floor surfaces, exits, driveways and
housekeeping standards.
• Ask your workers about any problems they have noticed.
• Review your incident and injury records (including ‘near misses’), as well as manufacturers’ information.
‘Practical issues to consider for your traffic management plan’ can help you decide what needs to be in your traffic
management plan.
ASSESS THE RISK
— caused by these hazards. PCBUs, supervisors and operators should ask these questions:
What is the potential impact of the hazard?
• How severe could an injury be?
• What is the worst possible damage the hazard could cause to someone’s health?
• Would it require simple first aid only? Or could it cause permanent ill health or disability? Or could
it kill? How likely is the hazard to cause someone harm?
• Could it happen at any time or would it be a rare event?
• How frequently are employees exposed to the hazard? You should also consider how many
people are exposed to the hazards
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 11
CONTROL THE RISK
— the most effective way to control risks is to eliminate them in the first place. If it is not practical to
control risks by eliminating them, consider other measures that can minimise them. When considering
potential control measures and deciding which to use, follow the priority order set out in the Hierarchy of
Control:
(1) elimination (most effective control) — e.g. consider options to eliminate the use of forklifts
(2) substitution — e.g. use a safer type of forklift
(3) isolation — e.g. provide an overhead pedestrian walkway
(4) engineering/redesign — e.g. use speed limiting devices on forklifts
(5) administration — e.g. training and/or warning signs
(6) personal protective equipment (least effective control) — e.g. high visibility vests.
Once you have considered potential control measures in the correct order, implement the most effective
controls practical, or a combination of controls. For example, can you eliminate risks by removing forklifts
from your workplace completely? If that is not practical, can you replace them with more people-friendly
load shifting equipment (such as a pallet jack or conveyor system)?
Other control measures might include creating more efficient routes and traffic flows; creating ‘no go’
zones; and using signs and barriers.
REVIEW CONTROL MEASURES
— Review your control measures to ensure they have been implemented and are not creating new
hazards. Repeat the hazard management process at regular intervals and also whenever there is a
change at your workplace or after a near miss or incident.
For more detailed information about the principles of hazard management, call your local
workplace safety authority.
PRACTICAL ISSUES TO CONSIDER FOR YOUR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN
• Designate exclusion zones for pedestrians and forklifts. Use impact barriers to separate pedestrians and
forklifts. Less permanent or less sturdy barriers, such as bollards or expandable fences may be adequate
for temporary demarcation. If less sturdy barriers are used, factor in the likely stopping distances by
considering the weight of the forklift and its expected load and the likely speed of the forklift.
• Audio visual warnings can supplement controls in areas of partial separation. A mix of high volume alarms
and horns coupled with flashing lights best warn pedestrians of approaching forklifts. Flashing lights are
imperative in areas of high levels of ambient workplace noise.
• Consider using proximity devices.
• Safety intersections and blind corners can be managed with devices that ensure pedestrians slow down or
stop, such as swinging or interlocked gates and chicanes. These controls can be enhanced by the addition
of overhead mirrors. Avoid placing bins, racks or storage units that obstruct a forklift operator’s view at
intersections or around corners.
• Use signs, containment fences, boom gates and even overhead walkways. Install signs that indicate who
must give way. Implement and enforce procedures that cover when and how pedestrians and forklifts must
give way to each other.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 12
• Create ‘no go’ zones for forklifts (pedestrian-only areas): e.g. around tearooms, time clocks,
amenities and entrances. Create clearly marked pedestrian crossings.
• Assess traffic destination, flow, volume and priorities (such as rail traffic).
• Consider high-visibility or reflective clothing for pedestrians and workers operating forklifts, and
high-visibility markings for forklifts. However, this is no substitute for physically separating
pedestrians and forklifts. Make sure that any high-visibility clothing does not blend in with other
brightly coloured objects in your workplace.
• Consider speed limits and speed-limiting devices.
• Examine the forklift and its characteristics: movement, stability, attachments, and braking
distances.
• Examine the loads being moved: their height and type.
• Look at security measures.
• Be alert for black spots caused by stationary equipment and vehicles. Black spots must be
controlled.
• Make sure roads are well formed, and clearly marked. Consider making roads two-way
carriageways.
• This list is not exhaustive, and does not replace the principles of hazard management.
RECORD YOU TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN
You should now be able to identify traffic flow, speed limits, parking areas, manoeuvring and loading
areas, ‘no go’ zones, pedestrian crossings, required ‘give ways’, and areas requiring actions in your
workplace.
Detail this information in a site map, and display it in your workplace. Everyone in your workplace,
including contractors and visitors, must know your traffic management plan. Use induction and training
sessions, and post information at workplace entrances and notice boards.
Creating a site map can help you analyse the workplace while developing the traffic management plan.
Once the plan is developed, the finalised site map will help reinforce and communicate the traffic
management plan. Review and monitor the traffic management plan at pre-determined and regular
intervals.

Other than site hazards what are things you need to consider when planning the task?
• Site Specific issues
• Communications (safe and adequate)
• Access to where you are going
• Location of task
• Specifics of task
• Permits required for the task
• Equipment required for the task
• Availability of equipment
• Capacity of forklift
• Characteristics of the load – weight, vol, nature (DG)

Before commencing a task or as soon as a hazard is identified during an operation the hierarchy of risk control is
used as a logical sequence of steps that should be considered to control hazards in the workplace.
HIERARCHY OF RISK CONTROL TABLE
Until you have a better method of control…
Other hazards within the workplace have specific requirement, for example overhead
powerlines, you must observe the following distances when conducting forklift operations near
uninsulated power lines?
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 16
POLICIES AND SAFE WORK PROCEDURES
Policies and safe work procedures ensure everyone who uses forklifts understands how to do
so safely and correctly.
Policies should cover the hazard management process; selecting a forklift; training and
licences; incident reporting and investigation. Safe work procedures (or operating procedures)
should cover many of the topics discussed in this guide, for example, checking the forklifts and
the workplace, using attachments, operating the forklift, carrying loads, and maintenance. Other
issues you should consider include fatigue, manual handling, refuelling, and battery charging.
As with your traffic management plan, everyone in your workplace, including contractors and
visitors, must know your policies and safe work procedures.
Provide contract staff with the same level of training on traffic management as direct workers.
Manage visitors so there is no possibility of them entering forklift operating areas. If this is not
possible inform them of ‘no-go’ areas or ensure visitors are accompanied by a worker. You
could use induction and training sessions, and post information at workplace entrances and
notice boards.
You should also review these regularly to ensure they remain appropriate and also ensure
people are complying with them.
INCIDENT REPORTING
Develop and implement an incident reporting procedure. Incidents involving forklifts must be
reported immediately to the manager or supervisor.
Reporting incidents allows you to:
• find out what went wrong and why
• improve work practices or the physical environment
• prevent similar incidents happening again. Near misses must also be recorded and
followed up. Reporting near misses can give you the chance of preventing a severe
accident, so treat them seriously. You may use the principles of hazard management in
this process.
It is important that if someone is killed or seriously injured — or could have been killed
or seriously injured at your workplace — Safework SA must be notified.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 17
COMMUNICATION
Involving workers in Health and Safety matters is a legal requirement and makes good business
sense. When management works with workers to achieve shared objectives workers are more
likely to understand decisions and actively support them.

Workers have a good understanding of high-risk activities in their work areas. By setting up a
communication system, where management and employees have a genuine opportunity to
exchange views, informed decisions can be made based on shared information. Effective
worker involvement and cooperation assists in preventing incidents, injuries and ill health. For
example communication could be used to alert workers of:
• Emergency situation
• The nature of the emergency
• Unsafe work areas or zones
• Information to emergency services i.e. ambulance, police or fire services personnel
The PCBU (person conducting a business or undertaking) should actively consider
arrangements for establishing formal consultative methods. For example, in larger organisations
consider health and safety representatives and safety committees. These arrangements should
be developed in consultation with workers, documented and communicated to everybody. For
smaller organisations, less formal systems such as regular 'toolbox' or safety communications
meetings can be considered. Some organisations combine formal and informal communication
methods very effectively. Communication methods could be:
• Visual Communication – WHS specially designed signs, electronic communication,
documents, and even presentation
• Written Communication – KPI reports, evaluations, emails, instant messages, physical
and electronic memos, training materials, and other types of documents i.e. Safety Data
Sheets
• Verbal Communication – Toolbox meetings, instructions and public address messages
(i.e. fire drills). Verbal communication would also involve active listening by workers
and supervisors to ensure the message is clear and understood
• Feedback Communication – Questioning to confirm understanding of workplace
communication and/or safe procedures
Any proposed changes to the work environment, work processes or the WHS management
system must be discussed with workers. PCBUs (Employers) must involve workers, so that
potential health and safety issues can be identified and resolved. Workers have the practical
experience that is valuable in ensuring that workplace changes are implemented effectively and
do not create further risks.
Training must be provided to all staff to ensure the communication you have established is
effective.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 18
OVERHEAD POWERLINES
The following distances MUST be observed when performing any work under or near to
overhead power lines.
• Low Voltage with a spotter: 3 m
• Low Voltage without a spotter: 6.4 m
• High Voltage with a spotter: 8 m
• High Voltage without a spotter: 10 m
If you are required to work closer than these minimum distances, the following controls could be
used to do this safely?
Controls include, but not limited to:
• Must seek an exemption from the relevant authority.
• Where possible have the electricity power shut off.
• If this is not possible, the power lines must be insulated.
• Depending on legislation of the state/territory, the use of a spotter within the exclusion
zone may be appropriate.
What is the best method to determine the voltage of over head power lines?
• Refer to the local power authority for advice
What should you do if the forklift truck you are operating comes into contact with power lines?
• If possible & without danger to self:
o Attempt to break the forklift’s contact with the power line by moving the forklift or
moving / lowering the mast.
• If NOT possible:
o You should remain on the forklift if it is safe to do so
o Do not touch any metal parts of the forklift
o Call for assistance!

WHAT IS MEANT BY A FORKLIFT TRUCK?
The Regulations define the term “Forklift Truck” as a powered industrial truck:–
(a) equipped with an elevated load carriage designed to permit tiering of one load on
another;
(b) equipped with forks or other load handling means;
(c) capable of self loading; and,
(d) on which the operator must ride to operate.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 20
YOUR FORKLIFT TRUCK IS MADE UP OF:
1. Mast
2. Back rest extension (load guard)
3. Load forks
4. Fork carriage
5. Drive axle and wheels
6. Steer axle and wheels
7. Overhead guard
8. Tilt cylinder
9. Counter balance (counterweight)

Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 22
FORKS
TYPES OF FORKS
The Pallet is the most common type of fork is use. It is designed to handle pallets or skids.
These forks are sometimes tapered on the bottom face so they can be used to chisel under
certain types of loads.
The Polished and Tapered fork is primarily used for chiselling operations. It is a thin fork that
has a very smooth finish. These forks can be tapered either top or bottom depending on the
intended chiselling operation. This fork can also be used for handling pallets or skids.
The Plywood fork is primarily used in the timber business. It is wider and thinner than a
regular fork and enables the operator to “chisel” between laminated timber sheets.
LENGTHS OF FORKS
The forks that are used should always be shorter than the load being handled. For example, a
standard pallet is 1200mm in length, therefore, the forks to be used should be approximately
1000mm in length. Fork length should always be shorter than the load length. Forks which
protrude beyond the load may cause damage; however, if the forks are too short then load
stability will be at risk. If ever faced with the situation where the forks are longer than the load,
the operator should endeavour to travel in reverse with the forks trailing.
As a general rule forks should always extend at least 75% of the distance under the load.
FORK EXTENSIONS (SLIPPERS)
Fork extensions are generally used to handle long loads. The slide over the regular forks and
give added length.
Fork extensions are an attachment and their weight should be taken into account as part of the
load being carried by the forklift. Using fork extensions eliminates the necessity to have more
than one pair of forks.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 23
LOAD LENGTH, FORK LENGTH & SPACING
SPACING
When picking up a wide load, the forks should be evenly spread out toward the sides of the
load.
The key points are to use the proper length of forks spaced correctly for the load. In most
cases load handling is performed with pallets.
 (1200mm x 1200mm for a standard Chep or Loscam Pallet).
The distance between the forks should be adjusted to be approximately between two thirds or
three quarters of the overall width of the pallet to give the strongest support and to enable
greater ease of manoeuvrability especially when stacking or de-stacking in confined areas.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 24
FORK HEIGHT TERMINOLOGY
A. The Collapsed Height is the
distance from the floor to the top
of the mast when the forks are in
their lowest position.
B. Free Lift is the distance the
forks may be raised before the
Collapsed Height is increased.
C. The Maximum Fork Height is
the distance from the floor to the
top of the forks when the mast is
fully raised.
D. Overall Extended Height
is the distance from the floor to
the top of the load back rest
extension when the mast is
fully raised.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 25
LIFT TRUCK STEERING FEATURES
REAR END STEERING
A. This allows the Truck to turn much sharper than those steered by the front wheels.
B. Tail swing is a characteristic of Forklift Trucks. This is the direct result of being steered
by the rear wheels. Operators need to become accustomed to this peculiarity in order to
avoid accidents.
WILL NOT SELF CENTRE
A. Before boarding the machine check the position of the rear wheels.
B. One hand must be on the steering wheel at all times during operation.
C. Travel at a safe speed to enable manoeuvres to be carried out safely.
POWER STEERING
A. Turn steering only when the forklift is moving.
B. If the forklift is fitted with pneumatic tyres ensure that they are inflated to
recommended pressures.
Never switch the engine off whilst the vehicle is in motion. Loss of engine power will result in
loss of power steering function.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 26
REAR WHEEL STEERING
The ability to drive an ordinary motor vehicle does not necessarily mean that a person is
capable of handling a forklift truck. The effect of rear wheel steering is similar to driving an
ordinary vehicle in reverse.
SPECIAL STEERING CHARACTERISTICS
Rear wheel steering also imposes different steering characteristics. When an ordinary vehicle is
turning, the rear wheels will “track” inside the turning arc of the front wheels. With rear wheel
steering, the rear wheels will “track” outside the front wheel arc. This action induces the
characteristic of rear end swing.
REAR END SWING
The tendency for the rear end to swing outside the arc of forward movement will become
apparent when observing the progress of the front of the vehicle. Rear end swing is a major
contributor to a considerable number of accidents involving forklift trucks. Novice drivers need
to be particularly careful of this feature.
Additionally, rear wheel steered vehicles will not revert
from a turning arc to a straight course if the steering
wheel is released. The tendency is for the turn to be
continued in a decreasing circular movement until
maximum lock is reached.
THE SPEED OF REAR END SWING WILL BE APPROXIMATELY
3 TIMES THE FORWARD SPEED OF THE FORKLIFT
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 27
TYPES OF PROPULSION
There are two distinct types of propulsion for forklifts: Internal Combustion Engines and Battery
Electric.
INTERNAL COMBUSTION
The internal combustion engine in a forklift works on the very same principles as those in a
normal motor vehicle. The variety of fuel sources are also similar to those of a normal motor
car and include petrol, diesel, LPG and CNG (compressed natural gas).
Gas powered vehicles are more often used indoors whereas those powered by petrol or diesel
are often larger and are used in outdoor environments. Petrol emits more toxic fumes (carbon
monoxide) than those using either LPG, CNG or diesel. Even with the advent of catalytic
mufflers these engines should not be idled unnecessarily in confined spaces.
More forklifts use the internal combustion engine rather than
battery power because of its greater versatility as a power
source. Considering that an internal combustion engine develops
more torque than a battery powered vehicle, it yields more
power. As a consequence, internal combustion engine forklifts
will have a higher grade climbing ability than a comparable
battery powered machine. Large outdoor forklifts always use
internal combustion engine due to their power requirements.
BATTERY
The major differences apparent in battery operated forklifts is that they are fume free, quiet
and, can be built to a smaller scale and should be maintained as to manufacturer’s
specifications.
Being fume free means they are ideally suited for use in
operations such as food processing or, manufacturing plants
where people are working in confined or poorly ventilated
areas. Their quietness is beneficial when used in an area
where noise would create a disturbance to workers. In contrast
to the internal combustion engine, the battery operated forklift
has fewer parts and can be built more compactly.
Lead acid batteries should be stored in a cool well ventilated area away from ignition sources
(eg welding, smoking etc.). A spill tray should be installed under the battery to contain any
spill. If installed batteries are at risk of metal tools or other conductive materials touching
terminals, then the terminals should be insulated.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 28
TYRES
There are four basic types of tyres used on forklifts.
• Pneumatic Tyres: Similar to those used on motor vehicles which are inflated with air.
• Semi-Pneumatic Tyres: Hollow centred tyres that operate at atmospheric pressure.
• Solid Tyres: A ring of solid rubber, neoprene or other rubber like material around the
wheel rim.
• Cushion Tyres: A solid tyre, but with a different tread and profile configuration to give it
some of the shock absorbing qualities not found in a solid tyre.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 29
CONTROLS AND INSTRUMENTS
HOUR METER
A most important instrument for which there are two reasons:-
1. Service intervals can be determined by worked hours on the machine. Similar to using
odometer readings for the servicing of motor vehicles.
2. Refuelling and even records of operating costs can be determined through hours worked.
CONTROLS
Some forklift truck controls are similar to, and operate in the same way as those found in a car:-
accelerator, brake, hand brake for parking.
Forklifts fitted with gear boxes giving a range of forward and reverse gears should always begin
travelling in the lowest gear possible. Low gear should also be used on ramps and when load
positioning.
INCHING
The majority of forklift trucks are equipped with power shift transmissions. In this case a clutch is
not required to change gear. The third pedal provided on some forklifts, mounted in the normal
position for a clutch, is an “inching pedal” (“clutch brake”). Use of this pedal by the operator
enables the truck to “inch” or move very slowly when operating in confined spaces or when fine
manoeuvring is required. The pedal is pressed part way in to “inch”. Depressing the pedal past
the inching position will apply the brake.
By using the inching pedal the operator is able to control the speed of the machine as well as
being able to neutralise the transmission and stop the machine. Once fully depressed, the
inching pedal will hold the machine (maximum braking), and neutralise the transmission without
having to move the gear selector. The accelerator can then be used for better hydraulic
response when initiating stacking, de-stacking and other static load shifting operations.
VERSATILITY
Forklift trucks can be made extremely versatile by adding to or replacing the forks with
attachments. Clamps, revolving carriages, booms, jibs and even shovels form just a few of the
attachments available. The most common attachment is the “side shift” which allows movement
of the forks up to 100mm (4 inches) left or right of centre of the mast.

PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the following section is to explain the PRINCIPLES which govern the operation
of forklift trucks.
In particular we shall be considering the concepts of:
• PIVOT POINT
• LOAD RATING
• LONGITUDINAL STABILITY
• LATERAL STABILITY
• CENTRE OF GRAVITY
• STABILITY TRIANGLE
An understanding of these principles is essential to gain an appreciation of the capabilities and
limitations of the forklift.
Most importantly, knowing these principles, will allow the operator to anticipate dangerous
situations and thus maintain a safer operation.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 31
PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION
FULCRUM OF BALANCE
The same principles that apply to a see-saw apply to a forklift. In diagrams A & B, equal weights
are placed an equal distance apart from the pivot point, the result is that they remain balanced.
This is SAFE. Note:- the pivot point of the forklift is at the front wheels.
The counterweight of the forklift must always be greater than the load. In the following
diagrams, counterweight C is greater than load D. This is SAFE.
In diagrams E & F a heavier load has been placed at one end. As a consequence a loss of
balance will occur. This is UNSAFE.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 32
UNDERCUTTING THE LOAD
In the diagrams below, equal weights have been placed each side of the pivot point, however
one of the weights has been placed further away from the pivot point than the other. When
operating a forklift this is called undercutting the load. This is UNSAFE.
Even if the weight of the load is less than the counterweight, by moving the load further away
from the pivot point, we can cause the forklift to tip forward. This is UNSAFE.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 33
LONGITUDINAL (FORWARD) STABILITY
There are several causes of forward instability. Overloading the forklift should never occur. This
is a highly dangerous practice and will invariably cause the forklift to tip forward. Other causes
of forward loss of balance can be cited as:
• Tilting the mast forward with the load raised high (diagram A). Undercutting the load
(diagram B)
• Travelling downhill or down a ramp with the load leading (diagram C)
Violent braking is another cause of forward instability and should be avoided at all costs
LATERAL (SIDEWAYS) STABILITY
Causes of sideways instability are:
• Travelling over uneven ground, pot holes etc., (diagram 1).
• Having the load unevenly balanced (diagram 2).
• Turning too fast (diagram 3)*.
* The most potential for disaster is turning too quickly. With rear end steering and moving at an
approximate speed of 10kph, turning the steering will cause the rear to accelerate to 3 times the
forward speed of the machine ie. 30kph. This can easily cause the forklift to tip sideways.

STABILITY - SUMMARY
FORWARD STABILITY
Is affected by: 1. Overloading
2. Sudden stops
3. Rough operation of controls
4. Exceeding load centre
5. Negotiating inclines
6. Collision with overhead obstructions
SIDE STABILITY
Is affected by: 1. Turning too fast
2. Turning on an incline
3. Incorrect tyre pressure
4. Ground obstructions
5. Unbalanced loads
Loads carried high with too much tilt and side-shift
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 35
STABILITY TRIANGLE
One of the most important concepts to understand about forklifts is that even though they have
4 wheels, they are only suspended at 3 points. The rear steering axle is mounted to the truck by
means of a pivot pin in the centre of the axle. This method of suspension allows for some
flexibility when travelling over rough ground.
Diagram A shows an imaginary triangle drawn between the two front wheels and the pivot pin in
the rear axle. The area within the lines is referred to as the Stability Triangle/Pyramid.
The centre of gravity of an object is the point within that object from which it could be
suspended in mid-air perfectly balanced. Whenever operating a forklift, the centre of gravity
must remain within the boundaries of the stability triangle, if not, the forklift will tip over.
Diagrams 1 to 6 describe what happens to the centre of gravity during normal operation. Some
forklifts have more degree of tilt than others and it should be noted that full backward or forward
tilt should only be used under prescribed circumstances.

LOAD CENTRE DEFINITION
Load Centre: The distance measured from the vertical face of the forks to the centre of gravity
of the load. Providing that the weight of the load is evenly distributed and the load is
against the backrest a more simple definition of load centre is Half the Length of the
Load.
In Diagram A the load length measures 1200mm (standard pallet) so the load centre is 600mm.
In Diagram B the load measures 1400mm, therefore, the load centre is 700mm.

MANUFACTURER’S DATA PLATES
DATA PLATES
The data plate attached to the forklift is an integral part of the safe operation of the forklift. After
studying the information you are made aware of the forklift’s maximum lifting capacity, load
centre and, maximum stacking height.
The data plate above describes that the machine can lift a maximum of 2150kg to a maximum
height of 3700mm providing the load centre does not exceed 600mm. When an attachment has
been added the data plate will show a reduced lifting capacity. The attachment (in this case a
“sideshift”) which has been added weighs 325kg. In consideration that this weight has been
added forward of the pivot point (the front wheels) the capacity of the forklift is reduced by the
weight of the attachment. The revised lifting capacity is calculated in the following manner:
Rated capacity 2150kg
Less - weight of attachment - 325kg
Reduced capacity = 1825kg
If a data plate is missing or unreadable, tag and report. Do not use.

LOAD CENTRE AND LIFTING CAPACITY
 1. 2. 3.
LIFT CAPACITY DECREASES AS THE LOAD CENTRE INCREASES
In Diagram 1 a forklift rated for lifting 2000kg with a 600mm load centre can safely lift the load,
providing the load is evenly distributed. In Diagram 2 the load centre has increased to 750mm
so the lifting capacity is reduced to 1700kg. In Diagram 3 the load centre has been increased
even further to 900mm so the lifting capacity is further reduced to 1400kg.
LOAD RATING GRAPH
The graph shows how the load capacity decreases as the load centre increases. The forklift
described on the graph can lift 3000kg as long as the load centre is 600mm or less. As the load
centre increases beyond 600mm, the lifting capacity is reduced, e.g. for a 750mm load centre
the lifting capacity is reduced to 2250kg. For a 900mm load centre the lifting capacity is further
reduced to 1750kg.
Under no circumstances can a forklift lift a greater load than the
stated maximum
- even if the load centre is less than that stated!

JIB ATTACHMENTS - USING THE FORKLIFT AS A CRANE
To further increase the versatility of a forklift truck, the use of a Jib attachment enables the
forklift to be used as a crane.
Before attempting to operate the forklift in this fashion it is important that the operator observe
certain safe practices and be aware of the operating requirements associated with any
equipment used in conjunction with the crane function.
1. Before attempting to lift a load using a jib attachment, the operator must ensure that the
attachment is:–
• in good order and condition;
• is correctly secured to the forklift;
• is fitted with a swivel hook (not a fixed hook); and
• is of suitable capacity for the lifting operation to be performed (the Safe Working Load
must be marked clearly at each hook position on the attachment).
2. When travelling with a load on the jib (hung load) the operator must ensure that
• the mast of the forklift is kept vertical or on back tilt at all times;
• the load is kept as low to the ground as possible;
• the jib attachment is kept as low to the ground as possible by using slings which are as
short as practicable to allow the task to be carried out safely; and
• when travelling and changing direction, forklift speed must be slow.
3. Only equipment which is specifically designed for the purpose should be used with a jib
attachment. NEVER hook or wrap slings around the tines of a forklift.
4. The operator must ensure that any slings or other fittings which are to be used are of a
capacity suitable for the task. The capacity of synthetic webbing slings is easily determined
by a colour coding method, as well as by the information tag attached to the sling by the
manufacturer. The capacity of flexible steel wire ropes and chains appears on the tag affixed
to the sling or is stamped on the ferrule.
5. The operator must ensure that all lifting gear is in good condition. All fittings must be
inspected for wear and damage. The maximum amount of wear permissible in a shackle is
10%. The shackle must be discarded at that point.
6. Loads must be correctly slung and must be secure before lifting.
7. The forklift must be on solid level terrain before lifting.
8. The operator must lift the load slowly and smoothly avoiding rough operation of controls
which could destabilise the forklift.
9. Ensure that the fork is centred directly over the load to minimise the possibility of the load
swinging. Once the load begins to swing the stability of the forklift is adversely affected.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 44
10. Where the load needs to be guided, tag lines made of dry, natural fibre rope of a minimum
diameter of 16mm should be used.
11. If at any stage the operator detects that the load has become unstable, the load should be
lowered immediately.
12. Loads should NEVER be raised over or near other people.
13. The pin of a shackle should always be “moused” (secured or tied in or secured to prevent it
from unscrewing during use).
LOAD FACTORS
The WLL of a sling is the maximum weight which can be lifted when the sling is vertical (a
straight lift). The load factor of a straight lift is 1. By altering the method of slinging, or, by
adjusting the angle between the legs of slings will affect the lifting capacity of the sling.
SLINGS
CARE OF SLINGS
1. When not in use, slings should never be allowed to remain on the ground, on wet and damp
surfaces, near substances which could cause corrosion or wear that may absorb rust, other
oxidants, or ashes.
2. Slings should not be dragged from beneath loads.
3. If slings will be contacting sharp edges etc., adequate packing should be used to prevent
damage.
4. Slings should never be overloaded or shock loaded.
5. Slings should never be exposed to excessive heat.
6. Slings should never be left exposed to the weather and must be kept away from salt water.
7. Operators should take care to prevent twists from developing, and should never knot or
cross twist kink any sling.
8. Slings should be inspected EVERY time before use and operators should inspect for:
• Broken wires or fibres
• Kinks
• High stranding
• Core slippage
• Excessive wear and corrosion
• Crushed or jammed strands
• Signs of stretching
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 45
INSPECTION OF SLINGS
CHAINS:
• Stretched, gouged, pitted or cut links
• Links locked or do not move freely
• Knots, twists and kinks
• Links crushed or worn more than 10% of their original diameter
• Cracked links
Most wear is likely to appear at the ends of each link or on the outer side of each link from being
dragged.
SYNTHETIC SLINGS:
• Damage to stitching, sleeve or protective coating
• Damage to eyes or to end fittings
• Abrasions, cuts and tears
• Variation in sling thickness
• Ensure labels are present
FIBRE ROPES:
• Knots, cuts or an excessive amount of broken fibres
• Rot due to moisture or sun baking
• Disintegration due to contact with corrosive chemicals
• High stranding
Should any of the above be found in the condition of the sling, then the sling should be taken
out of service immediately and either be repaired (where possible), or dis-carded from use. To
ensure that faulty equipment is not used by unsuspecting par-ties, all equipment withdrawn
from service should be clearly marked.

BASIC DE-STACKING RULES
1. Approach the stack slowly, square and centre and
stop half to 1 metre from the stack. At this point bring
the mast to the vertical.
2. Left foot on inching brake (if equipped) - right foot
covering the accelerator (RPM may be required for
better hydraulic response). Raise forks to a position
permitting clear entry into the pallet or dunage.
3. Fully engage the forks by moving forward into the
pallet until the front face of the forks “kiss” the deck
board. (Slight forward tilt may assist).
4. Lift the load until clear of the stack (approx 100mm)
and apply just enough back tilt to stabilise the load. Do
not apply backward tilt before lifting.
5. When the load is clear of the stack or rack look behind
to make sure the way is clear before reversing. Move
slowly backwards only as far as is necessary to clear
the face of the stack. (Approx half to 1 metre).
6. Lower the load gently to the correct travelling height,
approx. 100-150mm before applying further back tilt to
cradle the load before moving off.
7. Extreme care must be taken to avoid jerking the
controls when tilting a load backward or forward -
especially when the load is at height.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 47
BASIC STACKING RULES
1. Approach stack slowly, square and centre with load low,
approx. 100-150mm high and tilted back to cradle the load
against the backrest.
2. Stop approximately half to 1 metre from the stack and
reduce the excessive back tilt.
3. Left foot on inching brake right foot covering the accelerator
(RPM may be required for better hydraulic response). Raise
the load to just above the required stacking height.
4. When the load is clear of the top, move forward into or over
the stack and stop approximately 200mm from the bottom
of the stack or rack.
5. Bring the mast to the vertical (the mast will then be close to
the stack and the forks should be in the horizontal position)
then gently lower the load onto the stack or rack.
6. When the load is securely stacked, lower the forks until
clear of the pallet. Look behind before reversing.
7. When clear of the rack (half to 1 metre) lower the forks to
the correct travelling height, approx 100-150mm before
moving off.

REACH TRUCK INTRODUCTION
A reach truck is a forklift with a load carriage which moves longitudinally relative to the truck,
away from the truck to pick up or deposit a load and toward the truck to enable the centre of
gravity of the load to be within the wheelbase of the truck whilst travelling.
Reach trucks are designed for narrow aisle work where manoeuvring space is generally more
restricted. Therefore, even greater care needs to be taken to avoid damaging racks, loads and,
the truck itself.
The data plate or rating plate on these trucks shows the maximum load that can be safely lifted
by the forklift when the mast or fork carriage is fully extended forward.
Loads in excess of this rating will cause the rear wheels to lift off the ground which in turn will
affect steering, braking and traction. This will endanger the operator and other persons in the
vicinity.
Reach trucks are designed to operate on clean, smooth and level floors. They have no
suspension, nor do they have the shock absorbing qualities of pneumatic tyres. They must not
be driven over floor hazards, broken pallets and other obstructions on floors.
All rules of operating counterbalanced trucks apply equally to non-counterbalanced trucks,
especially those rules which apply to loads when the forks are “reached” forward of the
stabilising wheels. There are additional special rules which must be observed when using reach
trucks.
It is important to remember that a forklift can lift its recommended maximum load only if the
centre of gravity of the load does not extend beyond its rated load centre and is not lifted to a
height greater than that shown on the data plate.
Note: The data plate for a reach truck refers to the capacity of the unit with the forks
REACHED FORWARD.
REACH TRUCK LOAD TABLE AND LOAD CENTRE
The table below shows a reach truck with a rated capacity of 1800kg with a load centre of
600mm. As can be seen by the load table, if the load centre extends beyond the 600mm rating,
the safe working load is reduced.

TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 49
REACH TRUCK DE-STACKING
1. Stop at the face of the stack and bring the mast to the
vertical position. If necessary, adjust the fork spread to suit
the width of the load and ensure that the weight of the load
is within the rated capacity of the machine.
2. Raise the forks to a position allowing clear entry into the
pallet or dunage strips.
3. Drive forward to bring the truck closer to the stack. Fully
insert the fork arms by reaching forward.
4. Lift the load until it is clear of the stack and carefully apply
enough backward tilt to stabilise the load.
5. When the load is clear of the top of the stack, reach back. If
necessary move the truck back sufficiently to clear the face
of the stack.
Ensure the way is clear before moving off and, take care
not to dislodge loads in adjacent stacks.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 50
REACH TRUCK STACKING
Reach trucks should never be driven, whether loaded or not, with
the reach mechanism extended. The brake should be applied
before operating the reach mechanism. No one should ever step
over the reach legs or put any part of the body between the mast
and power unit if the truck is capable of being operated. The
reach mechanism should not be used for pushing or dragging
loads and, the load should be carried on the forks and not resting
on the reach legs unless the truck is specifically designed for this
purpose.
LOADING AND STACKING WITH REACH TRUCKS
1. Approach the stack with the load low, reached back
and tilted backwards to cradle the load.
2. Stop at the face of the stack, apply the brakes and
reduce the excessive backtilt.
3. Raise the load to the required stacking height.
4. When the load is clear of the top of the stack, drive
forward if necessary, re-apply the brakes then reach
forward taking care not to disturb other loads in
adjacent stacks.
5. When the load is over the stack, bring the mast to the
vertical position and lower the load onto the stack.
6. When the load is securely stacked, lower the arms
until free of the pallet and reach back. At this position,
slight forward tilt might be of assistance, otherwise it
should seldom be necessary to use forward tilt. If the
fork arms are not fully clear of the stack, the truck
should be moved back a short distance, after ensuring
the way is clear.
7. When the fork arms are clear of the stack, re-apply the
brakes if the truck has been moved. Tilt the fork arms
backwards and lower them to just above ground level
before moving off.

• Make sure dock plates and bridge plates are secure before use
• Ensure trucks and freight cars have wheels blocked to prevent rolling
• Do not run into other goods, fixtures or fittings
• Do not ram into stacked goods
• Space the forks to fit the load
• Ensure pallets are evenly loaded
• Restack unstable pallets before lifting
• Replace or stack damaged pallets on a sound one
• Never work within 3 metres of low voltage lines and 8 metres of high voltage power lines
with a Spotter & 6.4 metres low voltage and 10 metres high voltage without a Spotter.. Also
check with Statutory Authorities.
• Never carry loads off centre
• Always come to a complete stop before reversing direction of travel
• Approach rail lines at a 45˚ angle and slow down
• Never have any part of the body outside the outline of the machine
• Never use the forklift as a personnel elevator except when using approved equipment
• Do not smoke or allow the engine to run whilst refuelling
• Lower the forks to the ground with the tips down when parked
• Put the gear lever in neutral before leaving the seat
• Do not cause damage to building structures such as doors, beams, walls and buildings
• Always apply the hand brake when parking
• When using more than one forklift to lift a load ensure that operators are experienced,
someone is in charge of the lift, minimise distance load is moved, machines are of similar
capacity and suitable for the job
• Give way to all emergency vehicles (Police, Fire, Ambulance, SES)
• Never park a forklift in front of emergency exits, fire fighting appliances, first aid stations or
on walkways or in flood prone areas
FINISHING WORK
• Before getting off the forklift, lower the fork arms to ground level, ensure the parking brake is
engaged, and the controls are in neutral.
• If the forklift is liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) powered, turn off the LPG at the cylinder.
• Do not park the forklift near a source of ignition, near a doorway, or near a pit.
• Park the forklift in a well-lit area under cover and on a level and even surface. Make sure the
forklift is at least three metres away from a power line or rail line.
• Remove the ignition key and secure the forklift at all times when not in use. (This will
stop unauthorised people from using the forklift.)

RULES FOR SAFE OPERATION OF FORKLIFTS
Only properly trained and authorized drivers should operate forklift trucks.
Are you qualified to be a forklift truck operator?
Are you familiar with the forklift truck you operate?
DON’T OVERLOAD
Check load weights and handle only within the rated capacity of
your forklift truck
Before picking up a load, be sure of where the load centre is
located
Safe operation requires understanding and observing the fork-lift
trucks rated load capacity
GO SLOW AND SOUND HORN AT CORNERS
Go slow whenever vision is limited or obstructed.
If your plant has traffic mirrors, use them.
Observe stop signs, stop your forklift truck completely,
sound the horn if necessary and then proceed with
extreme caution.
ALWAYS USE LOAD BACKREST EXTENSION and OVER-HEAD GUARD FOR HIGH
STACKING
Be especially alert for falling objects when high stacking.
Make sure no loose articles are lying on top of the load

RULES FOR SAFE OPERATION OF FORKLIFTS
SLOW DOWN FOR SLIPPERY AREAS
It is very easy to lose control in slippery conditions.
Driving a forklift truck is not trying to win a
Safari Rally, although the conditions may
sometimes be rather similar!
WATCH SIDE CLEARANCE
Watch your side clearance, especially with wide loads.
Where possible, drive in the centre of the aisle to avoid
endangering personnel and equipment.
WATCH REAR END SWING
Because the rear wheels steer your truck, the rear end
swings wide when you turn.
Use care in aisles and other tight places.
DON’T CARRY PASSENGERS
Don’t use your forklift truck for moving loads for
which it was not designed.
There is NO safe place on a forklift truck for a
passenger to ride, and they could fall off
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 56
RULES FOR SAFE OPERATION OF FORKLIFTS
AVOID RUNNING OVER LOOSE OBJECTS
Remove hazardous, loose objects rather than driving over
or around them.
Avoid holes and bumps that might disturb your load.
DO NOT PERMIT ANYONE TO STAND UNDER ELEVATED FORKS
Never stand or pass, or permit anyone else to stand or
pass under the elevated forks whether empty or
loaded.
Load could fall, hydraulic or mechanical failure or
operator error
SEAT BELTS
Ensure seatbelts are correctly fitted and worn (for example, by installing intelligent systems, the
forklift can only be started if the seatbelt is fastened).
Monitoring/supervision of these intelligent systems should be such that they cannot be easily
defeated. Seatbelts may be retro-fitted, but only in accordance with the manufacturer’s
specifications.
Tipping over is the biggest danger for a worker using a forklift! If a worker jumps from a tipping
forklift, the chances of serious injury are high. Seatbelts save lives and must be worn.
A forklift can tip over by rolling or overturning sideways; or by pitching forward when the back
wheels lift off the ground.
Forklifts can tip over if you:
• accelerate quickly in reverse;
• brake too quickly, especially on a loaded forklift;
• brake or accelerate while cornering;
• brake or accelerate down a slope;
• carry a load facing down a slope;
• carry an unevenly balanced load;
• collide with another vehicle;
• drive across inclines or uneven ground, such as potholes (particularly with a height
difference greater than 20mm across the front wheels);
• drive with the fork arms raised too high (loaded or unloaded);
• strike low doors or overhead structures;
• turn too fast; or
• use a forklift that is not designed to tow (pushing or pulling)

CALCULATION
LENGTH
You can measure how long things are, or how tall, or how far apart they are. Those are all
examples of length measurements.
Example: This fork is 20 centimeters long. These are the most common measurements:
• Millimeters
• Centimeters
• Meters
• Kilometers
AREA
The formula is:
Area = w × h
w = width
h = height
Example: What is the area of this rectangle?
We know w = 5 and h = 3, so:
Area = 5 × 3 = 15
Mass (Weight)
Mass: how much matter is in an object.
We measure mass by weighing, but Weight and Mass are not really the same thing.
These are the most common measurements:
• Grams
• Kilograms
• Tonnes
Grams are the smallest, Tonnes are the biggest.
 
Transport Training Centre – TLILIC2001A
TTC Forklift Manual 2012 V14 Page 58
Grams
A paperclip weighs about 1 gram.
Grams are often written as g (for short), so "300 g" means "300 grams".
A loaf of bread weighs about 700 g (for a nice sized loaf)
Kilograms
Once you have 1,000 grams, you have 1 kilogram.
1 kilogram = 1,000 grams
A dictionary has a mass of about one kilogram.
Kilograms are great for measuring things that can be lifted by people (sometimes very strong
people are needed of course!).
Kilograms are often written as kg (that is a "k" for "kilo" and a "g" for "gram), so
"10 kg" means "10 kilograms".
When you weigh yourself on a scale, you would use kilograms. An adult weighs
about 70 kg.
But when it comes to things that are very heavy, we need to use the tonne.
Tonne
Once you have 1,000 kilograms, you will have 1 tonne.
1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms
Tonnes (also called Metric Tons) are used to measure things that are
very heavy.
Things like cars, trucks and large cargo boxes are weighed using the
tonne.
This forklift weighs about 2.5 tonnes.
Tonnes are often written as t (for short), so "2.5 t" means "2.5 tonnes".
Final thoughts about measuring weight:
1 kilogram = 1,000 grams
1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms
Weight or Mass?
We have used the word "weight" only because that is what people commonly say.
But we really should use is "Mass".
