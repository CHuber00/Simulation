# Disney's FastPass+ System - Write Up
**No FastPass at 95% utilization**  
As can be seen in the boxplot, the average residence time is close to 20 minutes without the FastPass system implemented.  

**95% Utilization with FastPass**  
The average residence time of regular customers starts to increase much more strongly after a ratio of 1 FastPass to 1 regular customer. Therefore, at 95% utilization, it seems as if having either 35% or 50% of tickets as FastPasses, because the waiting times for regular customers in between 35-50% and after 50% rise significantly.

**50% Utilization with FastPass**  
The graph is pretty surprising, because I would expect the residence time for FastPass customers to rise less significantly. On the other hand, this makes sense has the utilization is so low that the FastPass Queue might fill up quicker than the regular queue. However, the waiting time at the highest ratio of FastPasses is still much less for FastPass customers than regular customers (makes sense). Additionally, the residence time for regular customers does not increase much over the whole spectrum of fractions.
For 50% utilization, any ratio of FastPasses to regular customers would be feasible. However, realistically, it would make more sense to reserve a certain percentage of tickets for regular customers, as some customers might want to attend a ride spontaneously or might not have access to the FastPass system. Therefore, I would suggest that 80% of tickets be FastPass tickets and 20% be regular tickets.
