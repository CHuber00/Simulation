# Disney's FastPass+ System - Write Up
**No FastPass at 95% utilization**
As can be seen in the graph, the average residence time is close to 20 minutes without the FastPass system implemented.  

**95% Utilization with FastPass**
At 95% utilization, it seems as if having either 35% or 50% of tickets as FastPasses, because the waiting times for regular customers in between 35-50% and after 50% rise significantly.

**50% Utilization with FastPass**
The graph is pretty surprising, because I would expect the residence time for FastPass customers to rise less significantly.
For 50% utilization, it would therefore make sense to either have no FastPasses at all or just a small fraction (at most 50%)
