### Make Your Own Predictions

## Choice of Text-Generation Tool
After some research, I chose the markovify tool. Markovify seems to be the simplest tool to generate text, as I was unable to find other generators with the same ease of use.  

## Choice of Text
Since the text needs to break nicely into medium-length chunks, I chose a text file containing Dr. Seuss rhymes from "Cat in the Hat" and some other of his books. In addition to being the right length, the sentences are also relatively simple (as it is a children's book), which, I hoped, would make text generation more accurate. Dr. Seuss also has a very unique style of phrasing.  

## Sample Outputs of the Tool (Selection of good outputs)
"When I wish to go!"
"Then he took every present!"
"He likes to drink."
"Sue sews crow's clothes?"
"It was too wet to go Bump!"
"If you have to open many cans. Could you? In a box?"
"Go ask your mother."
"I do not like them here and there"

Bonus: "I can fan with the chicks and clocks, sir, mixed up with the fan as I stand on a noodle-eating poodle. THIS is what the cat said..."  


## Room for Improvement
I think that this generator could be much better if it had access to a larger database of Dr. Seuss books. However, I was unable to find more (free) text files containing his rhymes. However, I still think that this generator is already pretty decent.
